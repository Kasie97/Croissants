      ü•ê  A BRIEF HISTORY OF CROISSANTS.
    </h1>
    <p>
        In 1915, Sylvain Claudius Goy recorded the first-known French version of the croissant recipe. Instead of brioche dough, as August Zang used, Goy transformed the recipe to use a laminated yeast dough. Lamination involves folding butter and dough to create thin, flaky layers of pastry.

    <p>Through its many evolutions, food experts and historians agree that the croissant has become a uniquely French pastry. The French government even named it as the national French product in 1920.

        Many other countries also have their own spin-offs of the croissant. From Spain‚Äôs cream-filled Xuixo to the American fast-food croissan‚Äôwich, it‚Äôs truly a staple of modern global cuisine.
